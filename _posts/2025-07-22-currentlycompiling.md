Hello!

Would someone be able to summarize how NASA is being affected by this administration and how uncertain its future is? I’m having a hard time explaining to my family how science is essentially being attacked right now. I’m so sorry to all the employees being affected by the govt. also, yall have all my love.

</h1>7 Facebook and the Dark Web: A Collision</h1>
Chapter Abstract:
“I2P: Who needs the IETF?”—From jrandom's collected I2P quotations Facebook's Tor hidden service, found at https://facebookcorewwwi.onion, is lightning in a bottle. It is at the intersection of all three legitimacies analyzed in this book: state delegation of rules and regulations to a standards body (in this case, the Internet Engineering Task Force [IETF]); corporate propriety (DigiCert, Facebook); nonprofit propriety (the Tor Project); hacker legitimacy (the [now disgraced] hacker wunderkind Jacob Appelbaum); and Dark Web authenticity (the notoriety of Silk Road). Thus, Facebook on Tor is an association of state-delegated power, respect of resources, and authenticity. It is also a symbol of the blurred lines between the Dark Web and the Clear Web, a collision of legitimation and delegitimation.

</h1>“Dark Web” Version of Facebook Shows a New Way to Secure the Web</h1>
<a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/innovation/dark-web-version-facebook-shows-new-way-secure-web/">Facebook says  </a>
it launched the site to better serve people who already access its services via Tor but are sometimes blocked by its automatic security controls. The organization behind Tor says hundreds of thousands of people access the site this way, for example from within Iran and China, countries where government authorities block Facebook access.

The new .onion site will prevent Tor users from being blocked and also offers additional security. Security experts that advised Facebook on its new service say it shows how Web companies can help people preserve their security and anonymity online.
